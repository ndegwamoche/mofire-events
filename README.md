# MoFire Events Website - WordPress Theme

This project is a basic WordPress theme website built for Mofire Events, a trending events company in Kenya, as part of a developer interview assessment by KCB Bank Kenya. 
The website features a dynamic homepage with company information and the latest upcoming events, as well as an events listing page powered by a custom post type (events). 

It features a clean, modern homepage with:

- **Static content** introducing the site and the company
- A **dynamic list** of the **3 most recent upcoming events**
- Responsive and mobile-friendly design
- A textured gradient hero section
- Easily extendable for more dynamic features

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- Built using a **custom WordPress theme** from scratch.
- The homepage features a custom template that:
  - Displays static company information.
  - Dynamically pulls the 3 latest upcoming events using `WP_Query` filtered by a custom post type or event date.
- Styling is done using CSS with a vibrant **gradient hero background** and **textured overlay** for enhanced design aesthetics.
- Mobile responsiveness ensured via media queries and flexible layout units (`rem`, `%`).
- Theme is built with extensibility in mind – more features like event filtering.
